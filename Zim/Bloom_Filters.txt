====== Bloom Filters ======
Created Monday 03 February 2014

I'd like to assume that a phone number would occupy approximately 16 bytes as a string and that we'd need to store several million of the things.

* Counting Bloom Filters allow deletion as well as insertion (use an array of integers initialized to zero to represent the bit array, a delete decrements the value in all of the positions that correspond to the bits set when hashing a value).
* Compressed Bloom Filters allow space savings when being transmitted.
* Retouched Bloom Filters trade off false positives and false negatives.
* Bloomier filters keep function values associated with set elements (thereby offering more than set membership).
* and so on, and so on...
