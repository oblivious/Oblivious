====== Nant ======
Created Wednesday 29 January 2014

To specify a version of .Net when using NAnt use this parameter: **-t:net-3.5**
Trying to set the requisite property in the **-D:** properties parameter resulted in an error saying that the property already existed.
This was part of trying to configure Jenkins to build a project using NAnt, but the NAnt plugin for that project seems a little limited. I had to add the -t:net-3.5 to the "targets" part of the form to set the framework version.
