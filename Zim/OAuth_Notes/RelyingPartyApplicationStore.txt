====== RelyingPartyApplicationStore ======
Created Wednesday 04 December 2013

Tried seeing what an unimplemented RelyingPartyApplicationStore would look like:

1. Second overload of GetAssociation called with parameters: Uri: "https://open.login.yahooapis.com/openid/op/auth" and some security requirements (hash settings, mostly defaults).

Waste of time, looks pretty complex, probably a large amount of data. Couldn't store it all in a cookie.
