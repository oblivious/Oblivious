Created Monday 22 July 2013

What needs to be done still:

~~Remove EdtsListener and IEdtsListener~~
~~Rename Edts2RelayListener and IEdts2RelayListener to EdtsListener and IEdtsListener.~~

~~Write tests for EdtsListener.~~
~~Ensure that EdtsListener is not blocking.~~

~~Refactor all code into a single project (excepting unit tests);~~
~~Refactor unit tests to match refactored project.~~

~~Provide descriptions for all classes and methods.~~

~~Ensure that every appropriate class is added to the service registry.~~

~~Add logs specifically for echo requests and responses.~~
~~Add additional logs for transactions in various states. Successful, Timed out.~~
~~Use the default log to track everything, then turn it off...~~

Verify that the folders / permissions will work as expected.

What is the default timeout?

~~Does asyncResult need to be threadsafe? Will it be overwritten?~~
