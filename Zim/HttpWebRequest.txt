====== HttpWebRequest ======
Created Wednesday 22 January 2014

**Otherwise known as 'HttpWebRequest is a strange fish indeed'**

WriteHeaders is a method that is called asynchronously?

WriteHeadersCallback(WebExceptionStatus errorStatus, ConnectStream stream, bool async)// looks like what I want... This is line 3072//
{
	if (errorStatus == WebExceptionStatus.Success)
	{
		bool completed = EndWriteHeaders(async);
		if (!completed)
			errorStatus = WebExceptionStatus.Pending
		else
			if (stream.BytesLeftToWrite == 0)
				stream.CallDone();
	}
}
